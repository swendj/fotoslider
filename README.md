# fotoslider

This is the "foto slider" script for our motor driven camera slider. 

The python script works on Raspberry Pi 2/3/4/B/+ with TFT display and keyboard and was tested on a Pi 3B. There is a X-interface based on tkinter available. Beside you can use terminal mode or a remote ssh connection. Libgphoto2 is integrated, Nikon or Canon cameras works fine with it.    

Just read the script, feel free to modify and have fun!
